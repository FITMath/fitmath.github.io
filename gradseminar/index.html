<br /><strong>Abstract:</strong> <p>

We prove the short-time asymptotic formula for the interfaces and local solutions near the interfaces for the nonlinear double degenerate reaction-diffusion equation of turbulent filtration with fast diffusion and strong absorption

\[
u_t=\big(|(u^{m})_x|^{p-1}(u^{m})_x\big)_x-bu^{\beta},
\]
with $0 < mp < 1$, $(m, p > 0)$, $0 < \beta < 1$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, and $t \geq 0$.

Full classification is pursued in terms of the nonlinearity parameters $m$, $p$, $\beta$ and asymptotics of the initial function near its support.
In the case of an infinite speed of propagation of the interface, the asymptotic behavior of the local solution is classified at infinity. Similar classification for the slow diffusion case ($mp>1$) was presented in a recent paper

where boundary heat flux and free boundary are components of the control vector, and optimality criteria consist of the minimization of the quadratic declinations from the available measurements of the temperature distribution at the final moment, phase transition temperature on the free boundary, and the final position of the free boundary. We develop gradient descent algorithm based on Frechet differentiability in Hilbert-Besov spaces complemented with preconditioning or increase of regularity of the Frechet gradient through implementation of the Riesz representation theorem. Five model examples with various levels of complexity are considered. Extensive comparative analysis through implementation of preconditioning and Tikhonov regularization, calibration of preconditioning and regularization parameters, effect of noisy data, comparison of simultaneous identification of control parameters vs. nested optimization is pursued.

<br /><strong>Abstract:</strong> <p>

We present a full classification of the short-time behaviour of the interfaces and local solutions to the nonlinear parabolic $p$-Laplacian type reaction-diffusion equation of non-Newtonian elastic filtration

\[
u_t=\big(|u_x|^{p-2}u_x\big)_x-bu^{\beta},

If interface is finite, it may expand, shrink, or remain stationary as a result of the competition of the diffusion and reaction terms near the interface, expressed in terms of the parameters $p,\beta, \text{sign}b$, and asymptotics of the initial function near its support. In some range of parameters strong domination of the diffusion causes infinite speed of propagation and interfaces are absent. In all cases with finite interfaces we prove the explicit formula for the interface and the local solution with accuracy up to constant coefficients. We prove explicit asymptotics of the local solution at infinity in all cases with infinite speed of propagation. The methods of the proof are based on nonlinear scaling laws, and a barrier technique using special comparison theorems in irregular domains with characteristic boundary curves. A full description of small-time behaviour of the interfaces and local solutions
near the interfaces for slow diffusion case when $p>2$ is presented in a recent paper

We study a class of antagonistic stochastic games of three players A,B, and T,

hostile attacks of random magnitudes with each other and also with player T exerted at random times.
At some point (ruin time), one of the two active players will be ruined, when the cumulative damages
become unsustainable. Of interest are the status of all players upon  and also at each time  prior to .
 We obtain an analytic formula for the joint distribution of the named processes and demonstrate its closed form

practical models, including stock option trading and queueing systems with vacations and (N,T)-policy.

<br /><strong>Abstract:</strong> <p>

Analyzing large datasets is essential in every branch of science including social, medical, and political sciences. An important task in statistical analysis of data is to discover relationships between variables. Several correlation factors have been introduced to quantify the association between variables in a dataset such as Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's correlation, and Distance correlation. Pearson’s correlation is a well-known measure of association that can detect the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Spearman’s and Distance correlations have been developed to address the shortcomings of Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Spearman’s can identify a monotonic relationship, while Distance correlation can describe the degree of independence by computing a value between zero and one where zero indicates independence of the two variables.

Correlation coefficients do not perform consistently when they are calculated for different types of relationships. Often the underlying relationship between variables are unknown and it is challenging to decide which correlation coefficient is appropriate to discover these hidden relationship. Our research is focused on combining these factors to obtain a single representative coefficient value. We combine these coefficients by assigning different weights and calculate a single weighted average. Here, we introduce a bootstrap weight function based on the standard error of the coefficients. It means, a coefficient with smaller error will receive a higher weight. The weight function is developed as ratio of the correlation factor to its bootstrap standard error. This method is tested by designing several simulations to study these correlation factors for different types of relationships including linear, polynomial, and exponential. First, we simulate the data for the aforementioned relationships with added Gaussian noise. We then calculate the correlation coefficients and combine them for corrupted relationships with low and high noise. Simulations demonstrate that these coefficients do not perform uniformly for different relationships and each can better identify a specific relationship. Hence, a combined correlation measure can better explain the relationship between variables when the underlying relationship is unknown.

We consider the inverse problem for the identification of the finite dimensional set of parameters for systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arising in systems biology. A numerical method which combines Bellman’s quasilinearization with sensitivity analysis and Tikhonov’s regularization is implemented. We apply the method to various biological models such as the classical Lotka–Volterra system, bistable switch model in genetic regulatory networks, gene regulation and repressilator models from synthetic biology. The numerical results and application to real data demonstrate the quadratic convergence. The results of the talk are published in a recent paper

<br /><strong>Abstract:</strong> <p>

A common important task in data mining is grouping the objects based on their similarities. Clustering analysis is a well-known technique for grouping the objects using their features. Several clustering methods have been developed. Among them k-means is a linear clustering method that is broadly used. It divides the data elements into linearly separable groups where the objective function is to minimize the Euclidean distances between the elements and their associated cluster centers.

Several methods have been developed to evaluate the clustering performance including normalized mutual information (NMI) and silhouette index. NMI needs at least partial true labels of the data elements while silhouette index does not need the true labels and can be used where true labels are unknown. The focus here is to study the clustering performance using silhouette index. We evaluate the clustering performance of silhouette index by implementing several simulations as follow.

We first simulated two distinct groups that are linearly separable. Then, we added Gaussian noise to spatial coordinates of each data point such that the original distinct groups slightly overlap. We increased the overlapped area of two groups gradually by increasing the standard deviation of noise. In this way, we generate multiple datasets with different overlapping extents. K-means clustering is applied to divide the simulated datasets into two clusters. Silhouette index is calculated for clustering results as well as true positive rate to assess the results. Average silhouette index and average true rate are computed for each noise level using several runs of Monte Carlo simulations. We then visualize average silhouette index and its confident interval with regard to noise level. We also plot the average true positive rate and its confidence interval vs. standard deviation of noise.

<br /><strong>Abstract:</strong> <p>

Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ be a probability
space $\left(\mathfrak{X},\mathcal{B}_\mathfrak{X}\right)$ be a Borel
$\sigma$-algebra induced by a $\sigma$-compact Hausdorff space, and $\pi$ be
a marked Poisson random measure (r.m.) on $\mathcal{F}\otimes\mathcal{B}_\mathfrak{X}$ directed by a (deterministic)
Borel measure $\mu\in\mathfrak{M}_\mathfrak{X}$. Then,
$\mathbb{E}e^{\theta\pi}=e^{\mu\left[L\left(\theta\right)-1\right]}$ ($L$ is the
Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the marks) is the Laplace-type functional of
r.m. $\pi$.

Suppose now that $\pi$ is perturbed by a "third-party"
$\varSigma$-measurable stochastic process $\eta$ ($\varSigma$ is a
sub-$\sigma$-algebra of $\mathcal{F}$) that makes $\pi$ change its
parameters, including the intensity rate, distribution of marks
$(L\left(\theta\right))$, and the led-measure $\mu,\,$subject to the
evolution of $\eta$. We denote such modulation by $\pi_\eta$. Previously, we
proved that such new construction is also a random measure (modulated by $\eta$). Now we target an associated Laplace-type functional
$\mathbb{E}e^{\theta\pi_\eta}$. Among other related ramifications of this analysis, it
is stochastic process


\[S\left(t\right)=S\left(0\right)e^{\theta\pi_\eta}\]
in an analog to the geometric Brownian motion that we refer to as a geometric
Poisson random measure modulated by $\eta$. This can find various
applications, in particular, to the stock market. Of further interest, is the
exponential intensity of the process in the form of

\[\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\frac{1}{t}\pi_\eta\left[0,t\right]}\big|\varSigma\right]\]
($\left[0,t\right]\subseteq\mathbb{R}_{+})$ that represents the mean
exponential return rate of a stock modulated by a semi-Markov process. We
find a closed-form expression for this functional.

<div class="right_col"><strong>Title:</strong> A hybrid method to estimate the full parametric hazard model
<br /><strong>Abstract:</strong> <p>

The survival analysis has been recently emerging by finding many new applications in several fields such as biology, medicine, demography, economics, engineering, and sociology. The goal of survival analysis is to fit a model that illustrates the relationship between the event’s time and some independent factors that might affect the survival time. Several approaches have been used for modeling survival data including parametric, nonparametric, and semi-parametric. 

We propose a hybrid method to estimate a full parametric hazard model. In the proposed method, the nonparametric estimate of the survival function by Kaplan Meier, and the parametric estimate of the logistic function in the Cox proportional hazard are combined to estimate the parameters of a full parametric hazard model. We compare the estimated hazard using the proposed method and the Cox model. The results show that the estimated hazard using hybrid method is improved in comparison with estimated hazard using the Cox model. The performance of each method is measured based on the estimated parameters of the distribution as well as goodness of fit of the model. Monte Carlo simulations carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Moreover, performance of these methods are compared using simulated and real data. The results show that the proposed hybrid method provided better estimates in comparison with the Cox model.
